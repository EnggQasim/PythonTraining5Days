    "2. **Before you write code, explain what you’re about to do.** For example, if the previous cell has an error that you want to fix, explain what caused the error and how you plan to fix it.\n",
    "3. **Before you execute code that has outputs, think about what you hope to learn.** This notebook will prompt you write down your thought process. Do not update your explanation after seeing the output, unless you made a genuine mistake when guessing (e.g. typo).\n",

    "This notebook will prompt you with questions. Please answer them in the markdown cell. Do not modify the questions. Your answers should be specific to the code that you are writing, so please avoid generic answers. For example, if asked, \"What do you plan to do?\", please avoid simply answering, \"I will test the code.\" Instead explain how you will test the code and why (e.g. \"I will now test the edge case of an empty list, which should return...\")."
